**Summoner is not a typical platform.** We have specifically engineered it, with great discipline, so that you (the developer) can clone our stack and run it locally. You will be running and testing your multi-agent system in the equivalent of a full production environment, so that you can deploy with confidence.

**Still not confident?** That's fine: we have a _[staging environment](https://staging.summoner.org)_ where you can deploy your agents and witness them working in the cloud with all the associated latency and connectivity required to do that. However, in order to utilize the staging environment you will need to develop your agent under the same strict discipline that made the platform possible: absolutely zero extra imports beyond the standard Python SDK are allowed.
